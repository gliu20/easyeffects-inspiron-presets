# Easyeffects presets for Dell Inspiron Laptops
Presets were created for Dell Inspiron Laptops

## Design goals
* Sound as transparent as possible to the listener (i.e. no excessive boosting of bass or treble)
* Avoid frequency ranges where the speaker struggles or produces little useful output (speakers have no useful output below 160 Hz and provides limited volume until 220 Hz)
* Avoid adding excessive color or audible artifacts to the mix

## Preset operating principles
* Equalizer with slight V-shape to tone down harshness and create space to highlight details and bass
* Upward compression to bring out details and increase punchiness of the sound and drive it harder into the bass enhancer
* Psychoacoustic bass enhancement to increase perceived bass
* Low-pass filtering to remove frequency ranges where the speaker generates little to no audible impact
* Maximizer to subtly increase volume and prevent clipping
